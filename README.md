# Arduino-MEGA---2.4-Tft-Shield-Count-Table-User-Interface--Engine-Cycle-Count-With-IR-Sensor.-
There are 5 motor rotation options in this project, and these will be screen interfaces.   We will design a console to navigate through the menus. With down button, Okey button and 3 status leds.    When we select the desired value on the screen with the button .. (For example 250 Coil ..). The motor will rotate as much as the selected value. There is an ir sensor controlling the rotation and it prints the number of rotations of the motor on the screen.   While these are happening, for example, it will open an output pin in the 100th loop and the Green Led on the console will show this and the screen will say "1. Role On", 200. Yellow Led and "On 2nd Role" in the loop. When the 250 reaches the final value, the Red LED will light up and the display will show "Finish" ...   And at the bottom of the screen it will say "Press exit to return" with Blue color
